The Aging Lexicon Project seeks to understand adult age differences in the development of lexical and semantic knowledge.
<br><br>
This webpage is the result of the <a href="https://aginglexicon.github.io/menu/symposium.html"> Symposium on The Aging Lexicon</a> that took place in <b>Basel, Switzerland, June 7-9, 2018</b>, and gathered experts in Psychology, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and related fields to discuss open issues concerning the aging lexicon. Learn more about the proceedings of this symposium from our joint <a href="/assets/pdf/WulffAgingLexicon2019.pdf">publication</a>.  
<br><br>
This webpage aims to serve as a home for the ideas and resources collected during the symposium. Over time we hope to grow the collection of resources in order to accelerate future progress in this area.
