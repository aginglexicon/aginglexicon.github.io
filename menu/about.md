The Aging Lexicon Project seeks to understand adult age differences in the development of lexical and semantic knowledge.

This webpage is the result of the [Symposium](https://aginglexicon.github.io/menu/symposium.html) on The Aging Lexicon in <b>Basel, Switzerland, from June 7 to 9, 2018</b>, which gathered experts in Psychology, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and related fields to discuss open issues concerning the aging lexicon with the goal of building bridges between the various perspectives, in order fostering research on the lifespan development of the mental lexicon. 

This webpage shall serve as a home for the ideas and resources collected during the symposium. Over time we hope to grow the collection of resources in order to accelerating future progress in this area.

If you have any suggestions for additions please leave a comment on [GitHub](https://github.com/aginglexicon/aginglexicon.github.io/issues/new).

Thank you,
